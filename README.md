## Changes 
This project is my first contact with backend in a practice way. Rocketseat gave all the frontend part already done, so I was able to focus on backend. I did the marathon with them and afterwards I did a lot of upgrades like:
- Put everything the way I like 
- Architeture, I changed it completely to something I find it easy to understand
- The database, they used SQL Lite, I changed it to MongoDB
- To do -> create a login page and make it works with JWT
